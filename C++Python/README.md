# C++ and Python Coding activities
These are a set of coding activites to help familiarize yourself with coding in both Python and C++. As you tackle these exercises, you may begin to notice the differences between coding in each language. The solution can be create in both languages, but for some exercises, it is encouraged to atempt one language before the other. 

Each of these coding exercises are taken from LeetCode.

## Exercise 1: Converting Roman Numerals to Arabic Numbers
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|------|
| I      | 1    |
| V      | 5    |
| X      | 10   |
| L      | 50   |
| C      | 100  |
| D      | 500  |
| M      | 1000 |

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.


## Exercise 2: Sort Colors
### Atempt first in Python, then C++
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Exercise 3: 3Sum
### Atempt first in C++, then Python
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Exercise 4: Basic Calculator
Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation. Tested operations are addition(+), subtraction(-), and use of parentheses. 


Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
